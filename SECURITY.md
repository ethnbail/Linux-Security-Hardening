# Security & Safety Notes

This repository is **education-focused**. The hardening guidance and scripts use **opinionated defaults** that may not fit every environment.

- **Always test in a non-production VM first.**
- Firewalls and SSH changes can cause **lockout**. Keep console access.
- Some controls reduce usability for convenience accounts; evaluate risk vs. usability.
- Keep your OS and packages up to date; review hardening after major upgrades.

If you find an issue, open a GitHub issue describing:
- Distribution and version (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04).
- What you ran (script flags).
- Log output and the failing check or task.
